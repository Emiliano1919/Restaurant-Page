A website to practice Javascript and Webpack

## Languages/Technologies used:
* Webpack
* CSS
* Html
* Command line
* npm
* Git

## Thoughts:
This project definitely helped me understand how to use webpack,
and the advantages of using npm to reduce the amount of commands being used.

During this project I had to deal with one particular bug:
* Event Listeners being triggered automatically without interaction.
This bug was solved thanks to the Debugger Breakpoints and by dividing my code into multiple functions in different documents,
this solution not only solved the bug but I personally believe it is quite tidy and good for abstraction.

In general this project gave me quite a lot of experience regarding
Dom Manipulation and JavaScript in general.

## To be improved/researched:
1. Can npm do more than this?
2. How to do a pattern using css.
3. More Javascript Methods.
4. Event Delegation.
