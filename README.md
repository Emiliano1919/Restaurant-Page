A website to practice Javascript and Webpack

## Languages/Technologies used:
* Webpack
* CSS
* Html
* Command line
* npm
* Git

## Thoughts:
This project definitely helped me understand how to use webpack,
and the advantages of using npm to reduce the amount of commands being used.

During this project I had to deal with one particular bug:
* Event Listeners being triggered automatically without interaction.
This bug was solved by dividing my code into multiple functions in different documents,
this solution not only solved the bug but I personally believe it is quite tidy and good for abstraction.

In general this project gave me quite a lot of experience regarding
Dom Manipulation and JavaScript in general.
